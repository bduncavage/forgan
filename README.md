# Frankie's Organ (forgan)

An HTML5 web audio API hack built for Music Hack Day SF 2012

It uses the Echonest API to retrieve metadata about a song and attempts to recreate the song using in-browser
audio synthesis. The Echonest audio summary data contains segments that describe discrete portions of the song,
such as duration and a pitch vector.

That information is used to compute an approximate representation of the song (*very approximate*).

It was built over a span of about 24 hours (the lion's share of it), so please excuse the messiness.
I plan on cleaning things up down the road.

## Summary
It still needs work to sound more like the source material, but I think it's pretty cool.
